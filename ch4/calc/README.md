# Built in functions and variables

This is a simple reverse Polish calculator from ch 4
with a bunch of built in functions and variable assignments
Here's the master list because I'm not going to remember these in a week.

## functions
* `ptop` => print top of stack
* `duplicate` => duplicate last item on stack
* `swap` => swap the last two elements on the stack
* `pall` => print the whole stack
* `sin` => sin(x) on previous item (ex: x sin)
* `exp` => 10ex on previous item (ex: x exp)
* `pow` => pow(x,y) on previous items (ex: x y pow)

## variables
* `last` => last printed value
* `a` - `z` => variable assignment (ex a=x or a = x)
  note: can't do complex assignment yet like a = c 8 +
