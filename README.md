# Goofy Practice in C
Come join me as I work through C examples in [(K&R) Second Edition ANSI C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzatAI/cs_books/master/The.C.Programming.Language.2nd.Edition.pdf) or don't. I'm not your mom.

I resused some files for some of the early chapter examples and used git
to track past code. Later chapters (around Ch3) have the code broken out
a little. These solutions have little to no error checking and the solutions
are somewhat convoluted but it was a fun exercise.
